# Pittsburghese-Translator-Alexa-Skill

## Summary
Are you planning a visit to Pittsbugh or Western Pennsylvania and want to talk like the locals? If you answered yes, then this is the Alexa skill is for you!

This is a **work in progress** skill in which a user will say a word or phrase and Alexa will repeat that word or phrase back to the user in Pittsburghese if a Pittsburghese translation of the phrase exists...otherwise it will just repeat the phrase back to you.

Other features coming sometime in the future
- repeat translation
- repeat and slow down the translation

## Developer Notes
This skill was built using the ASK CLI. More info on how to get started can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html).

Contributions are welcome. We're specifically looking for ideas for Pittsburghese phrases to store for Alexa to repeat back.

## Disclaimer
Not everyone in Western Pennsylvania actually talks like this, but sometimes playing into stereotypes can be fun.
