Version 1.0.0 is live in the Alexa Skill Store [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0787M1125/ref=sr_1_13?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1513400727&sr=1-13&keywords=pittsburgh)

**Currently working on improvements for version 2.0.0**

## Summary
Are you planning a visit to Pittsburgh or Western Pennsylvania and want to talk like the locals? If you answered yes, then this is the Alexa skill is for you!

This is a skill in which a user will say a word or phrase and Alexa will repeat that word or phrase back to the user in Pittsburghese if a Pittsburghese translation of the phrase exists...otherwise it will just repeat the phrase back to you.

Once a phrase is repeated back, the user has the option to repeat the phrase, repeat/slow down the phrase, or translate another phrase.

## Developer Notes
This skill was built using the ASK CLI and is deployed via [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). More info on how to get started can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html).

Contributions are welcome. We're specifically looking for ideas for Pittsburghese phrases to store for Alexa to repeat back. Check out our contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/deeheber/pittsburghese-translator-alexa-skill/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Disclaimer
Not everyone in Western Pennsylvania actually talks like this, but sometimes playing into stereotypes can be fun.
