## Summary
Are you planning a visit to Pittsburgh or Western Pennsylvania and want to talk like the locals? If you answered yes, then this is the Alexa skill is for you!

This is a skill in which a user will say a word or phrase and Alexa will repeat that word or phrase back to the user in Pittsburghese if a Pittsburghese translation of the phrase exists...otherwise it will just repeat the phrase back to you.

Once a phrase is repeated back, the user has the option to repeat the phrase, repeat/slow down the phrase, or translate another phrase.

## Developer Notes
This skill was built using [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).

Contributions are welcome. We're specifically looking for ideas for Pittsburghese phrases to store for Alexa to repeat back. Check out our contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/deeheber/pittsburghese-translator-alexa-skill/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Disclaimer
Not everyone in Western Pennsylvania actually talks like this, but sometimes playing into stereotypes can be fun.
