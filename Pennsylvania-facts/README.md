## Developer Notes
The `index.js` file is just the code that can be placed in an [AWS lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). You will also need to do some other setup in order to tinker with the code locally.

Amazon official documentation can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/steps-to-build-a-custom-skill.html).
